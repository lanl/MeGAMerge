MeGAMerge
=========

MeGAMerge (A tool to merge assembled contigs, long reads from metagenomic sequencing runs)

MeGAMerge is a perl tool to accept any number of files containing assembled contigs of any length in Multi-FASTA format, and produce an improved assembly based on OLC based assembly.  All overlap parameters (Minimum Overlap Length, Identity, etc) are user-declarable at runtime. 

Requirements:

Must have the following tools installed and in PATH, or added to $binpath in the tool:

-Newbler (specifically runAssembly)

-Minimus2 (part of AMOS, requires MUMMer)

Usage:

MeGAMerge-1.0.pl [options] output_directory <list of fastas>

Options:

-overlap=NN            Parameter for minimum overlap length in minimus2/Newbler (default = 80)

-minID=NN              Minimum % identity for overlap in minimus2/Newlber (default 98)

-conserr=NN            Maximum conservation error for minimus2 (default 0.06)

-cpu=NN                Number of CPU for Newbler (default 4)

-bindir=directory      Directory containing MUMmer executables and AMOS executables

-newblerdir=direcoty   Directory for newbler executable (runAssembly)

-o=outfile             Name of final file to output in output_directory (default MergedContigs.fasta)

-minLen=NN             Minimum length to include in newbler assemblies (default 150)

-minIncludeLen=NN      Minimum length to include in minimus assembly (default, 200)

-d=1                   Turns on debug information

-single_genome=1       Runs assuming single genome, reducing auto-options
                       (one newbler run, exclude fewer contigs, overrides -minLen and minIncludeLen)
